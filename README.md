Navalingo-public is a display-only snapshot of the Navalingo frontend (React + Lexical), an AI-powered writing assistant that provides Grammarly-style grammar and spelling suggestions, along with high-quality English and Spanish translation. The editor interface is built for a smooth, responsive writing experience, with real-time error highlighting, clean text formatting, and accurate language switching. This public repository is intended solely for portfolio and code review purposes â€” it includes no backend services, secrets, or runnable build, and certain configuration files have been replaced with safe placeholders.\
